# Array Manipulation Challenge

## Description

String Transformation Challenge  
This challenge involves writing a JavaScript function called stringTransform that performs operations on a string based on its length. The function has the following behaviors:  

1. If the length of the string is divisible by 3, it reverses the string.
2. If the length of the string is divisible by 5, it converts each character to its ASCII code and concatenates them.
3. If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, it first reverses the string and then converts each character to its ASCII code.

## Functionality

1. If the length of the string is divisible by 3, it reverses the string.
2. If the length of the string is divisible by 5, it converts each character to its ASCII code and concatenates them.
3. If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, it first reverses the string and then converts each character to its ASCII code.


## How to Use

To use the `String_Transformation` function, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/array-manipulation-challenge.git
   
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd String_Transformation
   ```

3. Open the String Transformation .js file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

4. Install Node if it is not currently available

   <mark> Feel Free to check the documentation of Node to download it perfectly acoording to your operating system </mark>
   Check out this [Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en)

5. Use the function StringTransform(string) where the string is the string you want to perform on operations.
6. Run this code

   ```
   node arrayManipulation.js
    ```
## Examples Usage

1. Reversing the String

   > const result = stringTransform('hello');
   > console.log(result); // Output: "olleh"

2. Converting Characters to ASCII

   >  const result = stringTransform('world');
   > console.log(result); // Output: "119111114108100"

3. Reversing the String and Converting Characters to ASCII

   > const result = stringTransform('example');
   > console.log(result); // Output: "elpmaxe"
